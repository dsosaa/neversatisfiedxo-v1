# Website Fix Documentation

## Issue Identified
The website `https://videos.neversatisfiedxo.com` was not working due to missing HTTPS/SSL configuration.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing HTTPS Support**: The nginx configuration only had HTTP (port 80) setup, no HTTPS (port 443)
2. **No SSL Certificates**: No SSL certificates were configured for HTTPS encryption
3. **Incomplete nginx Configuration**: The nginx config was missing SSL server block and certificate mounting

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated nginx Configuration
**File**: `config/nginx.conf`

**Changes Made**:
- Added HTTPS server block listening on port 443 with SSL
- Added HTTP to HTTPS redirect (port 80 → 443)
- Added SSL certificate configuration
- Added security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- Properly structured nginx configuration with `events` and `http` blocks

**Key Features Added**:
```nginx
# HTTP server - redirect to HTTPS
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name videos.neversatisfiedxo.com www.videos.neversatisfiedxo.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

# HTTPS server
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name videos.neversatisfiedxo.com www.videos.neversatisfiedxo.com;
    
    # SSL configuration
    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/key.pem;
    # ... SSL settings and security headers
}
```

### 2. Generated SSL Certificates
**Script**: `scripts/generate-ssl-certs.sh`

**Actions**:
- Created self-signed SSL certificates on VPS
- Generated private key (`key.pem`) and certificate (`cert.pem`)
- Set proper file permissions (600 for key, 644 for cert)
- Certificates valid for 365 days

### 3. Updated Docker Compose Configuration
**File**: `docker-compose.prod-unified.yml`

**Changes Made**:
- Added SSL volume mount to nginx service
- Mounted local SSL directory to `/etc/nginx/ssl/` in container
- Updated nginx service to include SSL certificate volume

**Volume Mount Added**:
```yaml
nginx:
  volumes:
    - ./config/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
    - ./ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl:ro  # SSL certificates
```

### 4. QuickSync Integration
**Process**:
- Used QuickSync to sync updated nginx configuration to VPS
- Used QuickSync to restart all services with new configuration
- Verified SSL certificates were properly mounted in nginx container

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
```bash
curl -I https://videos.neversatisfiedxo.com
# Result: curl: (7) Failed to connect to videos.neversatisfiedxo.com port 443
```

### After Fix
```bash
curl -k -I https://videos.neversatisfiedxo.com
# Result: HTTP/2 307 (redirect to /enter)
# Headers include: Strict-Transport-Security, X-Frame-Options, etc.

curl -k -L https://videos.neversatisfiedxo.com/enter
# Result: Full HTML page loads successfully
```

## Security Features Implemented

1. **HTTPS Redirect**: All HTTP traffic automatically redirected to HTTPS
2. **HSTS Headers**: Strict-Transport-Security header for browser security
3. **Security Headers**: X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options
4. **CSP Headers**: Content Security Policy for XSS protection
5. **SSL/TLS Configuration**: Modern TLS 1.2/1.3 with secure cipher suites

## Current Status

✅ **Website Working**: `https://videos.neversatisfiedxo.com` is fully functional
✅ **HTTPS Enabled**: SSL encryption working with self-signed certificate
✅ **All Services Healthy**: All Docker containers running and healthy
✅ **QuickSync Working**: Changes can be synced via QuickSync system

## Notes for Production

1. **SSL Certificate**: Currently using self-signed certificate
   - Browsers will show security warning
   - For production, replace with Let's Encrypt or commercial SSL certificate

2. **Certificate Renewal**: Self-signed certificate expires in 365 days
   - Monitor expiration date
   - Set up automated renewal for production

3. **Security**: All security headers implemented
   - HSTS, CSP, XSS protection enabled
   - Modern TLS configuration

## QuickSync Commands Used

```bash
# Sync all changes to VPS
./scripts/quicksync.sh all sync

# Check service status
./scripts/quicksync.sh all status

# View nginx logs
./scripts/quicksync.sh nginx logs
```

## Files Modified

1. `config/nginx.conf` - Updated with HTTPS and SSL configuration
2. `docker-compose.prod-unified.yml` - Added SSL volume mount
3. `scripts/generate-ssl-certs.sh` - Created SSL certificate generation script
4. VPS SSL certificates - Generated in `/opt/neversatisfiedxo/ssl/`

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test HTTPS connection
curl -k -I https://videos.neversatisfiedxo.com

# Test full page load
curl -k -L https://videos.neversatisfiedxo.com/enter

# Check SSL certificate
openssl s_client -connect videos.neversatisfiedxo.com:443 -servername videos.neversatisfiedxo.com
```

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Replace Self-Signed Certificate**:
   ```bash
   # Use Let's Encrypt
   certbot --nginx -d videos.neversatisfiedxo.com
   ```

2. **Set up Certificate Auto-Renewal**:
   ```bash
   # Add to crontab
   0 12 * * * /usr/bin/certbot renew --quiet
   ```

3. **Monitor SSL Certificate Expiry**:
   - Set up monitoring for certificate expiration
   - Alert 30 days before expiry

The website is now fully functional with HTTPS support and can be accessed securely at `https://videos.neversatisfiedxo.com`.
